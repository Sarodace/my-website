My name is Jonathan, an Electrical Engineer with a passion for art, design, and philanthropy. 
Since graduating from WPI, I have been working at Analog Devices as an Applications Engineer on products that help enable the shift to 5G and have gained experience with project management, cross-team collaboration, and ensuring that our customer's questions and concerns about products are answered and addressed. 

After work, I take classes for my MS ECE at WPI (so my freetime is non-existent ðŸ˜”). Once I graduate in May 2023, I'll be working on projects and hobbies that I've had to leave in the planning stage due to my severe lack of time. Until then, feel free to look around and remember to check back :) !

If you're here to gauge my technical knowledge, I'd recommend you start by looking at my projects in Hardware and Software.
